## Recipe Converter working version

#### Version 1.0

V1 now handles instances of integers and fractions. Still must be updated to include ranges

Considering further improvements to convert many basic ingredients, such as salt, to be converted to grams


#### Trial Version

Current version is unable to handle instances of integers and fractions e.g. 1 1/2, as well as ranges e.g. 1/2 - 3/4.

Single fractions e.g. 1/2 are converted without issue.

After handling these issues, will conduct further testing to check for other possible formats that may be encountered, before moving selected code to the final version sans test code etc.
